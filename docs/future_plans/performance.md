## Offline Mode Capabilities

### Feature Explanation
Offline mode capabilities allow the plugin to function without an active internet connection by leveraging locally stored models or cached data.

### Purpose
This feature ensures that users can continue using the plugin even in environments with limited or no internet connectivity, enhancing reliability and accessibility.

### Implementation
- Integrate lightweight, locally deployable AI models for basic functionality.
- Cache frequently used data and responses for offline access.
- Provide a fallback mechanism to switch between online and offline modes seamlessly.
- Include a settings option to enable or disable offline mode.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with local storage for caching data and models.
- A settings interface for managing offline mode preferences.
- Notifications to inform users when the plugin switches between online and offline modes.

## Response Streaming

### Feature Explanation
Response streaming enables the plugin to display AI-generated responses incrementally as they are generated, rather than waiting for the entire response to be completed.

### Purpose
This feature improves the user experience by reducing perceived latency, allowing users to read and interact with responses in real-time.

### Implementation
- Use the ChatGPT API's streaming capabilities to receive partial responses.
- Update the user interface dynamically to display the streamed content.
- Implement error handling to manage interruptions in the streaming process.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with the ChatGPT API's streaming endpoints.
- A user interface component for rendering streamed responses.
- Settings to enable or disable response streaming based on user preference.

## Background Processing

### Feature Explanation
Background processing allows the plugin to execute tasks, such as generating responses or processing data, without blocking the main user interface.

### Purpose
This feature enhances responsiveness by ensuring that the plugin remains interactive while performing resource-intensive operations in the background.

### Implementation
- Use asynchronous programming techniques to offload tasks to background threads.
- Implement a task queue to manage and prioritize background operations.
- Provide visual indicators (e.g., loading spinners) to inform users of ongoing background tasks.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with the plugin's core processing engine to support asynchronous operations.
- A task manager interface for monitoring and managing background tasks.
- Notifications for task completion or errors.

## Memory Optimization

### Feature Explanation
Memory optimization reduces the plugin's memory footprint by efficiently managing resources and minimizing unnecessary data retention.

### Purpose
This feature ensures that the plugin performs well on devices with limited memory, preventing slowdowns or crashes due to excessive resource usage.

### Implementation
- Use memory profiling tools to identify and address memory leaks.
- Implement lazy loading to load resources only when needed.
- Optimize data structures and algorithms for efficient memory usage.
- Provide settings to adjust memory usage based on user preferences (e.g., cache size).

### Interaction Points
- Integration with memory management tools for monitoring and optimization.
- A settings interface for configuring memory-related preferences.
- Logs and diagnostics for identifying and resolving memory issues.
