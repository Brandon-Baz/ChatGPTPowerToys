# Future Plans: Security Features

This document outlines the planned security features for the ChatGPT PowerToys plugin. These features aim to ensure the safety, privacy, and integrity of user data while maintaining compliance with best practices and regulations.

## End-to-End Encryption

### Feature Explanation
End-to-end encryption ensures that all data transmitted between the user and the plugin's backend is encrypted, making it inaccessible to unauthorized parties.

### Purpose
This feature protects sensitive user data from being intercepted or tampered with during transmission, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

### Implementation
- Use industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3) for data in transit.
- Implement encryption at the application layer to secure data before it leaves the user's device.
- Ensure compatibility with existing APIs and services used by the plugin.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with the plugin's communication layer to encrypt outgoing and decrypt incoming data.
- A settings interface to display encryption status and provide troubleshooting information.
- Compatibility with third-party services that require secure communication.

## Secure Credential Storage

### Feature Explanation
Secure credential storage ensures that user credentials, such as API keys or login information, are stored safely and cannot be accessed by unauthorized entities.

### Purpose
This feature prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and services by securely storing sensitive credentials.

### Implementation
- Use platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Windows Credential Locker, macOS Keychain).
- Encrypt credentials using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
- Implement access controls to restrict access to stored credentials to authorized processes only.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with the plugin's settings menu for managing stored credentials.
- A secure interface for users to input, update, and delete credentials.
- Notifications for credential-related events, such as expiration or invalidation.

## Privacy Mode

### Feature Explanation
Privacy mode allows users to temporarily disable data logging and tracking features to ensure maximum privacy during sensitive interactions.

### Purpose
This feature provides users with control over their data, ensuring that no sensitive information is logged or stored during private sessions.

### Implementation
- Add a toggle in the settings menu to enable or disable privacy mode.
- Temporarily disable logging mechanisms and clear session data when privacy mode is activated.
- Display a visual indicator in the plugin interface to inform users when privacy mode is active.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with the plugin's logging and analytics systems to suspend data collection.
- A user interface element for toggling privacy mode.
- Notifications to confirm activation or deactivation of privacy mode.

## Data Retention Policies

### Feature Explanation
Data retention policies define how long user data is stored and provide mechanisms for users to manage or delete their data.

### Purpose
This feature ensures compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and gives users control over their data.

### Implementation
- Define default retention periods for different types of data (e.g., logs, conversation history).
- Provide a settings interface for users to view and manage their stored data.
- Implement automated mechanisms to delete expired data securely.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with the plugin's data storage systems to enforce retention policies.
- A user interface for configuring retention settings and initiating data deletion.
- Notifications to inform users about upcoming data deletions or policy changes.
