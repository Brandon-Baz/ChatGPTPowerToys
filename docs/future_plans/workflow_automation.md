## Task Automation with Prompt Chains

### Feature Explanation
Task automation with prompt chains allows users to define a sequence of prompts that are executed in order, with the output of one prompt serving as the input for the next.

### Purpose
This feature enables users to automate complex workflows by chaining multiple prompts together, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistency in repetitive tasks.

### Implementation
- Provide a user interface for creating, editing, and managing prompt chains.
- Allow users to define dependencies between prompts and specify how outputs are passed to subsequent prompts.
- Store prompt chains locally or in a cloud-based configuration for portability.
- Execute prompt chains sequentially, handling errors gracefully and providing logs for debugging.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with the ChatGPT API to process each prompt in the chain.
- A settings menu for managing prompt chains.
- A visual editor for designing and testing prompt chains.

## Scheduled Queries

### Feature Explanation
Scheduled queries allow users to set up prompts that are executed at specific times or intervals.

### Purpose
This feature helps users automate recurring tasks, such as generating daily reports or sending reminders, without requiring manual input.

### Implementation
- Provide a scheduling interface for users to define prompts and their execution times.
- Use a background task scheduler to execute prompts at the specified times.
- Notify users of the results via the plugin interface or email.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with the operating system's task scheduling APIs for reliable execution.
- A user interface for configuring and managing scheduled queries.
- Notification settings for customizing how results are delivered.

## Batch Processing

### Feature Explanation
Batch processing enables users to execute a single prompt or a prompt chain on a batch of inputs, such as a list of files or data entries.

### Purpose
This feature streamlines workflows by allowing users to process large datasets or multiple inputs in one operation, saving time and effort.

### Implementation
- Provide an interface for uploading or selecting batch inputs (e.g., files, text entries).
- Execute the prompt or prompt chain on each input in the batch.
- Aggregate results and present them in a user-friendly format, such as a table or downloadable file.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with file system APIs for handling batch inputs.
- A progress tracker in the user interface to monitor batch processing.
- Export options for saving batch results in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).

## Windows Task Scheduler Integration

### Feature Explanation
Windows Task Scheduler integration allows users to leverage the operating system's native scheduling capabilities to automate prompts and workflows.

### Purpose
This feature provides a robust and reliable way to schedule tasks, leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Windows Task Scheduler.

### Implementation
- Provide an option to export scheduled queries or prompt chains as Task Scheduler tasks.
- Use the Task Scheduler API to create, update, and delete tasks directly from the plugin.
- Ensure compatibility with various Windows versions and user permissions.

### Interaction Points
- Integration with the Windows Task Scheduler API for task management.
- A user interface for configuring Task Scheduler settings (e.g., triggers, conditions).
- Logs and notifications for monitoring task execution and troubleshooting errors.
